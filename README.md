## Technologies
- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the different pages. There will be pages for the login, home page, and an about section. Pages will have hyperlinks.
- **CSS** - Choose different font colors, background colors, margins/padding, and borders that will organize the page and be aesthetically pleasing.
- **JavaScript** - Used for interacting with the timer and to-do list and provides login
- **React** - Used to efficiently make all the pages interactive and handle user input
- **Web Service** - Use a timer API to create and adjust the timer
- **Authentication** - Can't save to-do list or completed pomodoros without authentication; show name at top
- **Database Data** - Store user info for login and save to-do list and pomodoro for users
- **WebSocket Data** - Shared to-do list you can edit with other users and chat box

# HTML Deliverable
The HTML structure was built for my startup. Here's how each of the aspects was incorporated:
- HTML Pages - Three pages: Index page as main page, About page to give additional info, and login page for users to log in
- Tags - Body, Nav, Main, Header and Footer tags all used correctly on each page
- Links - Navigation links at the top of each page to all the other pages
- Text - Lots of Text on the about page and message on home page
- 3rd Party - Back, Pause/Play, and Skip are all placeholders for Timer API functions
- Images - Decorative image on about page and image to represent timer
- Login placeholder - Input box for login and shows user's name
- Database - Items in the to-do list and showing completed pomodoros
- Websocket - Example of shared to-do list and chat box
