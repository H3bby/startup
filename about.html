      <h2>What is Pomodoro?</h2>
      <div>  
        <p>
        The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique that helps you focus in small bursts,
        called pomodoros. Breaking your productivity into smaller, more managable sessions helps prevent
        burnout and reduce procrastination.

        <ol type="1">
          <li>Focus on a task for 25 minutes with no distractions</li>
          <li>Take a break for 5 minutes</li>
          <li>After 4 focus sessions (pomodoros), take a 30 minute break</li>
          <li>Repeat as many times as needed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        The Pomodoro technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s when he was struggling to
        focus in college. He decided to use a tomato kitchen timer to work in 25 minute
        increments. Pomodoro means "tomato" in Italian.
